Slovenian Highrise Translation
==============================

## Why?

My parents don't understand English, but they wanted to use beautiful CRM Highrise by 37signals.

## How does it work?

Everytime page loads English words are replaced with translations. It is not perfect, but it works ok. Someone who doesn't speaks English can use app pretty much without a problem.

## How to install??

Install with Tampermonkey for Chrome or Greasemonkey for Firefox.

## Info

It is work in progress.
