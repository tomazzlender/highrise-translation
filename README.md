37signals Highrise translation
==============================

## Why?

There are people who can't use beautiful web app Highrise by 37signals because they don't understand English words. For example my parents :).

## How does it work?

Everytime page loads English words are replaced with translations. It is not perfect, but it works ok. Someone who doesn't speak English can use app pretty much without a problem.

## How to install?

Install with Tampermonkey for Chrome or Greasemonkey for Firefox. File highrise.translation.sl.js must loads first then highrise.translation.helper.js.

## Languages

- Slovenian

Looking for another one? Translate "highrise.translation.sl.js".

## Authors

It is work in progress.
