37signals Highrise translation
==============================

## Why?

My parents don't understand English, but they wanted to use beautiful CRM Highrise by 37signals.

## How does it work?

Everytime page loads English words are replaced with translations. It is not perfect, but it works ok. Someone who doesn't speaks English can use app pretty much without a problem.

## How to install?

Install with Tampermonkey for Chrome or Greasemonkey for Firefox. File highrise.translation.sl.js must loads first then highrise.translation.helper.js.

## Languages

- Slovenian

Looking for another one? Translate "highrise.translation.sl.js".

## Authors

Code and slovenian translation is developed by Tomaž Žlender. Some code is copied from https://github.com/ninefingers/so-translation.

It is work in progress.
